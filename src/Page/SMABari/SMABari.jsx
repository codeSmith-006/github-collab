I’m a passionate web developer with a strong foundation in the MERN stack — MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. After completing the Programming Hero MERN Bootcamp, I’ve gained real-world experience building responsive and scalable web applications that solve real problems.

💡 My journey in tech is not just about writing clean code — it’s about a burning dream of one day building systems that think, evolve, and inspire. I’m deeply interested in AI consciousness, full-stack architecture, and how we can use technology to bridge the gap between human cognition and digital systems.

🔥 I’ve worked on multiple real-world projects, including landing pages, component-based designs, and dynamic web pages. Each project taught me how to think critically, adapt fast, and keep building.

🎯 My goals are:
To become a top-tier full-stack developer.
To keep learning about the world with genius people.
To contribute to open-source and meaningful tech communities.

✅ Tech Stack Highlights:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, Tailwind, DaisyUI
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
Tools: Git, GitHub, VS Code, Netlify, Firebase, Linux
Learning: Next.js, TypeScript, and deep-diving into AI basics

🙋‍♂️ A bit more about me:
- Learning more about computers and how they work is my favorite hobby. The way a just box turned into the most important thing in the world really fascinates me the most.
- Favourite books: Elon Musk by Walter Isaacson, Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson, Can't Hurt Me by David Goggins.
- Outside of coding, I enjoy browsing about AI, consciousness, history, and religions. I watch a lot of sci-fi movies and anime. I also enjoy long-distance running to prepare my body for sitting for long hours.
- Fun fact: I love chocolate more than coffee, even as a developer.
